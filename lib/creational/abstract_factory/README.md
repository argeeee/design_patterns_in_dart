# Abstract Factory

This is example of how to implement the Abstract Factory design pattern using the Dart programming language.
The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

In this example, we've implemented the Abstract Factory pattern to create views for different operating systems. By using the abstract factory interface and concrete factories, we can easily switch between different operating systems while maintaining a consistent interface for creating views.

You can expand on this example by adding more concrete view classes and factories for other operating systems, such as Linux or mobile platforms.

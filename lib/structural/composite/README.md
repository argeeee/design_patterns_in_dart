# Composite

The Composite design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. The key idea behind the Composite pattern is that a component can be either an individual object or a group of objects (composite). The composite pattern enables you to work with these objects uniformly through a common interface.

To understand the Composite pattern, let's explore its components:
1. Component: This is the common interface that declares operations that are applicable to both individual objects and compositions. It provides methods for accessing and manipulating components, such as adding, removing, or retrieving child components.
2. Leaf: This represents individual objects that have no child components. They implement the operations defined by the component interface.
3. Composite: This represents a composite object that can have child components. It implements the operations defined by the component interface and also provides methods for managing child components, such as adding, removing, or iterating over them.

The Composite pattern allows you to create complex object structures by composing smaller components into larger ones recursively. This recursive composition allows you to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly, simplifying the client code that interacts with them.
